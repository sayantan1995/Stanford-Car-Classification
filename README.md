# Stanford-Car-Classification
This capstone project aims to build a machine-learning tool capable of precisely and accurately classifying cars by their make, model and year from images acquired from the Stanford car dataset using deep learning. 
# Data
The data for this project was sourced from the Stanford car dataset. The files present in the CSV files folder were provided alongside the all the car images which can be downloaded from the kaggle link below, these CSV files remain unmodified and the clean test and train CSV files were obtained through running the clean_data_files.py.
