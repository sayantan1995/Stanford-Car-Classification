# Stanford-Car-Classification
This capstone project aims to take images from the Stanford car dataset and use deep learning to create a machine learning tool capable of successfully identify and classifying the cars in the images by their manufacturer, model, and year. 
# Data
The data for this project was sourced from the Stanford car dataset. The files present in the CSV files folder were provided alongside the all the car images which can be downloaded from the kaggle link below, these CSV files remain unmodified and the clean test and train CSV files were obtained through running the clean_data_files.py.
